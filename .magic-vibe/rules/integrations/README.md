# Integration Rules

Integration protocol rules for AI agents to connect with external systems, services, and standardized communication protocols.

## Available Rules

- **[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](mcp.md)** - Universal protocol for AI agents to connect with external tools and data sources

## Auto-Detection

AI agents automatically detect integration requirements based on:

- Configuration files and environment variables
- Project dependencies and SDK installations
- API documentation and service endpoints
- Integration setup guides and examples

## Integration

Integration rules provide the foundation for AI agents to access external capabilities while maintaining security, performance, and reliability standards across all integrations.
