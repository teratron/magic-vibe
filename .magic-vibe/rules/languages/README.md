# Languages Rules

Programming language-specific rules for AI agents to apply when working with projects in specific languages.

## Available Rules

- **[Python](python.md)** - Python development standards, PEP compliance, testing with pytest
- **[TypeScript](typescript.md)** - TypeScript/JavaScript development, type safety, modern ECMAScript  
- **[C++](cpp.md)** - Modern C++ standards, memory management, performance optimization
- **[Rust](rust.md)** - Rust development patterns, ownership, error handling, cargo workflows
- **[Go](go.md)** - Go programming standards, idioms, concurrency patterns, and best practices
- **[PHP](php.md)** - Modern PHP development, PSR standards, type safety, and performance optimization

## Auto-Detection

AI agents automatically detect programming languages based on:

- File extensions and source code patterns
- Project configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build system files and tooling configurations

## Integration

Language rules work alongside Magic Vibe core rules and complement framework-specific rules for comprehensive development guidance.
