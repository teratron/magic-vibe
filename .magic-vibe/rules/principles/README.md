# Development Principles

Universal development principles that AI agents should apply across all programming languages, frameworks, and project types to ensure high-quality, maintainable code.

## Available Principles

- **[Object-Oriented Programming](oop.md)** - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
- **[SOLID Design Principles](solid.md)** - Five fundamental principles for maintainable design
- **[DRY Principle](dry.md)** - "Don't Repeat Yourself" - eliminate code duplication
- **[KISS Principle](kiss.md)** - "Keep It Simple, Stupid" - maintain simplicity
- **[YAGNI Principle](yagni.md)** - "You Ain't Gonna Need It" - implement only what's needed

## Universal Application

These principles apply to every piece of code regardless of programming language, framework, or project complexity. They form the foundation of quality software development practices.

## Principle Priority

When principles conflict, apply in order: KISS → YAGNI → DRY → SOLID → OOP, always favoring simplicity and current needs over speculative complexity.

## Integration

Development principles work with all other Magic Vibe rules, providing the philosophical foundation that guides language-specific implementations, framework usage patterns, and workflow processes.
