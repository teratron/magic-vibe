# Setup Multi-MCP Data Processing Pipeline

## Description

Create a comprehensive data processing pipeline that integrates multiple MCP clients to handle data ingestion from various sources (database, filesystem, external APIs) and process the data through a unified workflow.

## Details

**MCP Integration Requirements:**

- **Database MCP Client**: Connect to PostgreSQL for reading user data and transaction logs
- **Filesystem MCP Client**: Access local file storage for processing CSV imports and exports
- **GitHub MCP Client**: Integration with repository for configuration management and deployment
- **API MCP Client**: Connect to external REST APIs for real-time data enrichment

**Implementation Steps:**

- Configure MCP server endpoints for each data source
- Implement data validation and transformation logic
- Create error handling and retry mechanisms for failed connections
- Set up monitoring and logging for all MCP interactions
- Establish data flow orchestration between different MCP clients

**Expected MCP Client Connections:**

1. `database` - PostgreSQL connection for core data operations
2. `filesystem` - Local storage access for file processing
3. `github` - Repository integration for configuration management
4. `api` - External service integration for data enrichment

**Security Considerations:**

- All MCP connections must use encrypted transports
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for each endpoint
- Validate all data inputs and sanitize outputs
- Log all security-relevant events and access attempts

**Performance Requirements:**

- Support concurrent connections to all MCP servers
- Implement connection pooling and resource management
- Handle graceful degradation when individual MCP servers are unavailable
- Maintain response times under 5 seconds for data queries

## Test Strategy

**MCP Connection Testing:**

- Verify successful connection to each configured MCP server
- Test authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Validate tool and resource discovery for each client
- Confirm proper error handling for connection failures

**Integration Testing:**

- Test data flow between different MCP clients
- Verify transaction consistency across multiple data sources
- Test system behavior under various failure scenarios
- Validate performance under concurrent load

**Monitoring Validation:**

- Confirm all MCP interactions are properly logged
- Verify error detection and alerting mechanisms
- Test diagnostic tools and recovery procedures
- Validate metrics collection and reporting

**Expected Test Results:**

- All 4 MCP clients successfully connected and operational
- Data processing pipeline handles 1000+ records per minute
- System maintains 99.9% uptime with proper failover mechanisms
- All security and audit requirements are met

## Documentation Requirements

**Technical Documentation:**

- MCP server configuration and setup instructions
- API documentation for each integrated service
- Data flow diagrams and architecture overview
- Security configuration and best practices guide

**Operational Documentation:**

- Monitoring and alerting setup procedures
- Troubleshooting guide for common MCP issues
- Performance tuning and optimization guidelines
- Disaster recovery and backup procedures

## Agent Notes

This task will automatically trigger the MCP orchestration hooks when the status changes to "inprogress". The system will:

1. **Initialization Hook** (`mcp-orchestration-start.hook.md`):
   - Create MCP client directory structure
   - Initialize configuration files
   - Execute client detection and connection logic

2. **Completion Hook** (`mcp-orchestration-cleanup.hook.md`):
   - Collect execution metrics and performance data
   - Archive MCP session data for analysis
   - Generate completion summary and reports

3. **Error Handling Hook** (`mcp-error-handling.hook.md`):
   - Diagnose connection failures and provide recovery suggestions
   - Archive error data for troubleshooting
   - Generate failure reports and system diagnostics

The MCP client manager will automatically detect the required services based on the task description and feature keywords, establishing connections to database, filesystem, GitHub, and API MCP servers as needed.
