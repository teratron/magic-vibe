# Working with Plans

Plans in Magic Vibe are comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that define project features and guide development workflows.

## What are Plans?

Plans are structured documents that:

- Define feature requirements and specifications
- Provide context for AI-assisted development
- Break down complex features into manageable components
- Track progress from conception to completion

## Plan Structure

Every Magic Vibe plan follows a standardized 8-section structure:

### 1. Overview & Objectives

- Feature purpose and business value
- Success criteria and metrics
- Target users and use cases

### 2. Requirements Specification

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Technical constraints
- Dependencies and integrations

### 3. Technical Architecture

- System design and components
- Data models and schemas
- API specifications
- Technology stack decisions

### 4. Implementation Strategy

- Development phases and milestones
- Task breakdown and sequencing
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment and mitigation

### 5. Quality Assurance

- Testing strategy and coverage
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Compliance requirements

### 6. Deployment & Operations

- Deployment strategy
- Monitoring and alerting
- Rollback procedures
- Maintenance requirements

### 7. Timeline & Milestones

- Project phases and deadlines
- Critical path identification

- Business metrics
- Technical metrics
- User satisfaction measures

## Creating Plans

### Using AI Assistance

Create a new plan with AI help:

```text
@.magic-vibe/rules/core/plans.md create a plan for user authentication system
```

The AI will generate a comprehensive PRD following the standard structure.

### Manual Plan Creation

1. Create a new file in `.magic-vibe/ai/plans/`
2. Use the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
3. Follow the 8-section template structure
4. Update the plan index in `PLANS.md`

### Plan Templates

Common plan templates are available for:

- **Feature Development**: New application features
- **System Integration**: Third-party service integration
- **Performance Optimization**: System performance improvements
- **Security Enhancement**: Security feature implementation
- **Infrastructure Setup**: DevOps and infrastructure changes

## Plan Management

### Plan Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Concept] --> B[Planning]
    B --> C[Review]
    C --> D[Approved]
    D --> E[In Progress]
    E --> F[Testing]
    F --> G[Completed]
    G --> H[Archived]
    
    C --> I[Rejected]
    I --> J[Archived]
```

### Status Tracking

Plans can have the following statuses:

- **Draft**: Initial planning phase
- **Review**: Under stakeholder review
- **Approved**: Ready for implementation
- **In Progress**: Active development
- **Testing**: Under quality assurance
- **Completed**: Successfully implemented
- **On Hold**: Temporarily paused
- **Cancelled**: Discontinued

### Plan Updates

Update existing plans:

```text
@.magic-vibe/rules/core/plans.md update the authentication plan with OAuth integration
```

All changes are tracked in the plan file and git history.

## Working with Plan Hierarchies

### Parent-Child Relationships

Large features can be broken into sub-plans:

```text
authentication-system.md           # Parent plan
â”œâ”€â”€ oauth-integration.md           # Child plan
â”œâ”€â”€ user-registration.md           # Child plan
â””â”€â”€ password-reset.md              # Child plan
```

### Plan Dependencies

Define dependencies between plans:

- **Prerequisite Plans**: Must be completed before this plan starts
- **Parallel Plans**: Can be developed simultaneously
- **Dependent Plans**: Cannot start until this plan completes

## Plan-to-Task Generation

### Automatic Task Generation

Generate tasks from approved plans:

```text
@.magic-vibe/rules/core/tasks.md generate tasks from the authentication plan
```

This creates:

- Individual task files in `.magic-vibe/ai/tasks/`
- Task entries in `TASKS.md`
- Proper task dependencies and sequencing

### Manual Task Creation

Break down plans manually:

1. Identify discrete work items
2. Create task files with clear deliverables
3. Establish task dependencies
4. Assign priorities and estimates

## Best Practices

### Plan Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Clear, measurable requirements
2. **Think Holistically**: Consider all system impacts
3. **Plan for Testing**: Include QA and validation strategies
4. **Consider Operations**: Deployment and maintenance needs
5. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural and design choices

### Collaboration Strategies

- **Stakeholder Review**: Include business and technical stakeholders
- **Iterative Refinement**: Regularly update plans based on feedback
- **Cross-Team Input**: Involve security, DevOps, and other teams
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and plan for potential issues

### Plan Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic plan assessment and updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor implementation against plan
- **Lessons Learned**: Document insights for future plans
- **Archive Completed**: Move finished plans to memory

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration

- Plans stored in version control for full history
- Branch creation tied to plan implementation
- Commit messages reference plan IDs
- Pull requests link to relevant plans

### CI/CD Integration

- Automated plan validation
- Deployment gates based on plan completion
- Quality checks against plan requirements
- Automated progress updates

### Team Coordination

- Shared plan visibility across team members
- Standardized plan format for consistency
- Clear ownership and responsibility assignment
- Regular plan review meetings

## Advanced Plan Features

### Reusable Plan Templates

Create reusable plan templates:

```text
